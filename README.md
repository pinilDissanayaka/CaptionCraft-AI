## 🚀 Project Overview
CaptionCraft AI is an advanced image caption generator that combines image recognition and natural language processing. With the help of LLMs for generating initial captions and RAG for refining them with contextual data, this tool produces accurate and enriched descriptions for your images! 🌟

## 🔧 Key Features
1. Image Captioning: Automatically generate descriptive captions for any image. 🖼️
2. Contextual Enhancement: Augment captions with relevant information retrieved from external sources using RAG. 📚
3. Customizable Knowledge Base: Easily integrate specific datasets or knowledge domains for specialized captioning. 🧑‍🔬
4. User-Friendly Interface: Upload your images and get captions instantly with an easy-to-use interface. 💻

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
1. Programming Language: Python 🐍
2. Image Processing: CLIP, TensorFlow, PyTorch 🖼️
3. Large Language Models (LLMs): GPT-4, LLaMA3 🤖
4. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): LangChain, Pinecone 🔍
5. Frontend: Streamlit 🎨
6. Database: Pinecone, FAISS 🗃️
  
## 🖥️ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run CaptionCraft AI on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
  
1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CaptionCraft-AI.git
cd CaptionCraft-AI
```

2. Installation
   
Install the required Python libraries: 🛠️
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Streamlit app for the frontend: 🌐
```
streamlit run app.py
```

## ✨ How It Works
1. Upload an Image: Choose any image from your device. 📤
2. Initial Caption Generation: The LLM generates a descriptive caption for the image. 📝
3. Contextual Refinement: The RAG pipeline retrieves additional relevant information to enrich the caption. 🔄
4. Display Result: View the enhanced caption directly in the app! 👀
